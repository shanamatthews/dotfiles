# Prints the terminal theme regular colors (and some other escapes). For
# "bright/bold" variation add 1; in front of the number. Useful for
# sampling and remembering the escapes when hardcoding them into scripts
# for portability. Keep in mind that the color names are those given for
# the original color terminal and obviously can vary widely. For color
# intensive output consider shortening the names to their first letter
# instead and don't forget to wrap them within ${}. Omits (and overrides
# any inherited) colors when not interactive/piped.
